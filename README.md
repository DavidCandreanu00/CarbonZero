# CarbonZero

Web3 platform that enables companies to be assigned Carbon Emission Rights and to trade peer-to-peer. The platform uses an off-chain order book, which enables faster and more efficient trading than traditional blockchain-based approaches.

The goal of this project was to create a complete platform that enables governments to assign allowances and oversee trading, and empowers companies to trade and manage their emissions allowance portfolio. A complex system was developed that encompasses trading and token assignment functionality on EVM blockchains, a functional web app and a server that maintains an off-chain order book in a database. The system was developed using SCRUM methodology, and good software engineering practices were respected. Every component was thoroughly tested using manual and automated tests, and user evaluation was conducted.
