# CarbonZero

Web3 platform that enables companies to be assigned Carbon Emission Rights and to trade peer-to-peer. The platform uses an off-chain order book, which enables faster and more efficient trading than traditional blockchain-based approaches.

The goal of this project was to create a complete platform that enables governments to assign allowances and oversee trading, and empowers companies to trade and manage their emissions allowance portfolio. A complex system was developed that encompasses trading and token assignment functionality on EVM blockchains, a functional web app and a server that maintains an off-chain order book in a database. 

In order to easily run the project’s code, a VM was created. All used tools (Ganache, MetaMask) and dependencies have already been installed.
